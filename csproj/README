This directrory is for staging builds of ConsensusCore and it's C# wrapper for use inside the PacBio P4-based build system.
ConsensusCore builds outside of the PacBio P4 tree should use targets in the top-level Makefile.

NOTE -- the C# binding files are generated by SWIG and deposited in build/CSharp. 
For the convenience of the build process, we hard-code the set of C# files into 
PacBio.Analysis.ConsensusCoreManaged. 
When the SWIG bindings changes you must take the following steps:
  
  1. Create a stub file in build/CSharp with the new filename
  2. Add it to p4 as a always-writable (p4 add -t +w <filename>)
  3. Add the new file to PacBio.Analysis.ConsensusCoreManaged.csproj
