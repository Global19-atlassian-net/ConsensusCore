/// \mainpage ConsensusCore
/// \section intro_sec Introduction
/// 
/// ConsensusCore is a C++ library containing several
/// consensus-calling algorithms used in circular consensus sequencing
/// (CCS) analysis.  Several of the algorithms are based on generic
/// multiple sequence alignment methods; (currently) one method is
/// based on a PacBio-specific error model.  ConsensusCore exposes
/// language bindings to C# and Python, thereby enabling integration
/// into the Pipeline and secondary analysis workflows.
/// 
/// ConsensusCore will be soon released as open source via our GitHub
/// page.
